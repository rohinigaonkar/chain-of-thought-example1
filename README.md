# üß† MCP Learning Project - Chain of Thought

This project demonstrates the implementation of chain-of-thought reasoning using the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and Google's Gemini AI. It showcases how to integrate mathematical operations with step-by-step reasoning and verification capabilities.

## üîß What's Inside
The project implements three key components:

### ü§î Chain of Thought Process

- Iterative reasoning with up to 10 steps
- Step-by-step problem decomposition
- Verification at each stage

### üßÆ Mathematical Tools

- Basic operations (add, subtract, multiply, divide)
- Advanced functions (factorial, log, trigonometry)
- Special operations (ASCII conversions, exponentials)

### ‚úÖ Verification Tools

- Result validation
- Step-by-step verification
- Error detection

## üí° Purpose
This project serves as a demonstration of:

- Implementing chain-of-thought reasoning with MCP
- Integrating Gemini AI for mathematical problem solving
- Building verification mechanisms into the reasoning process

### üõ°Ô∏è Error Handling

The system includes robust error handling for:

- Invalid mathematical operations
- Verification failures
- Tool execution errors
- Response timeouts

### üí° Example Usage

python mcp-client.py "Calculate sum of first two prime numbers"
```

Example output at the end.

### System Prompt:

```
{
  "explicit_reasoning": true,
  "structured_output": true,
  "tool_separation": true,
  "conversation_loop": true,
  "instructional_framing": true,
  "internal_self_checks": true,
  "reasoning_type_awareness": true,

```

‚úÖ Explicit Reasoning Instructions: Uses a dedicated show_reasoning tool with steps and tagged reasoning type.

‚úÖ Structured Output Format: Enforces strict JSON formatting for all outputs‚Äîensures reliable parsing.

‚úÖ Separation of Reasoning and Tools: Differentiates clearly between reasoning (show_reasoning), function execution, and final results.

‚úÖ Conversation Loop Support: Designed to operate over multiple steps with clarity and guidance for each stage.

‚úÖ Instructional Framing: Rich set of rules, examples, and do‚Äôs/don‚Äôts ensures precise behavior.

‚úÖ Internal Self-Checks: Incorporates verification logic (verify tool) for validating results.

‚úÖ Reasoning Type Awareness: Explicitly tags the reasoning type in the show_reasoning step.

‚úÖ Error Handling or Fallbacks: Covers non-mathematical queries with clear fallback instruction.

‚úÖ Overall Clarity and Robustness: Highly readable, comprehensive, and designed for error minimization and consistent behavior.
